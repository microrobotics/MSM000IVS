High Sensitivity Vibration Module

The MSM series vibration sensor use piezoelectric ceramics and spring weight structure to detect vibration. The small piezoelectric signals are fed through an high sensistivity operational amplifier to produce a digital output (high or low). Sensitivity can be adjusted by rotating a screw connected to a potentiometer which attenuates the input signal and make it less sensitive. The sensor can also be combined with a single-chip microcontroller or wireless transmitter.
